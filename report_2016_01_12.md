- Added to workflow documentation
  * Documented process to set up a repo's hook/service integration with ReadTheDocs [Document](doc-workflow/docs-rtd-hook.md)
  * Began draft of using ReadTheDocs with Project Jupyter [Document](doc-workflow/docs-readthedocs.md)
- Began coming up with Jupyter notebooks to track documentation activity and metrics across the many repos in an automated fashion
