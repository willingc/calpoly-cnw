## What's going on with Carol
Date: 12-22-2015

### Development
- nbextensions dev call
- Created ipywidgets Sphinx docs
- Updated notebook docs for 4.1.0rc1 (Thanks Min for autoversion enhancement)
- Added "What's New in Release" right hand sidebar directive to notebook and jupyter docs

### Documentation Sustainability and Effectiveness project
* Created a left hand doc sidebar section structure for Sphinx docs to give top level structure to all documentation in repos
  yet encourages flexibiity in individual project docs within the structure
    - User Documentation (Documentation for usage of project)
	- Configuration
	- Developer Documentation (Documentation related to release development)
	- Community Documentation (Examples and Tutorials)
    - About (changelogs and history)
	- Questions & suggestions (mailing list, website, stack overflow links)
	- *Projects (documentation links)*
* Researched Cyrille Rossant's **ipymd** documentation converter project. Has promise yet today only supports older IPython 3 notebooks
* Researched Sphinx extensions esp. autodoc and intersphinx for technical developer documentation and interproject links
* Began inventory of repos and related docs (what, freshness, and needs)
* Researched pandas, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, and django docs for structure, ideas, and good practices
