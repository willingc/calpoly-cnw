# The Magical World of git

## The Whats
### What is git?
git, version control software, is an **application** that is used as a tool to
move project files around. It can help you keep track of your rough drafts,
ideas, and presentations. git is also very helpful for enabling multiple users
to work on different stories in a newsletter.

### What is GitHub?
Some people think all roads lead to GitHub for source code version control and
git. GitHub is a cloud **service** that allows users to have accounts and the
ability to store projects, or more accurately repositories, in these accounts.

>Trivia: The cute GitHub icon is called OctoCat.

### What is a terminal?
It's a window where you type commands for the operating system to do something for you.

### What is bash?
It is a shell within the window that is used to directly communicate with the operating system.
Other shells are ZSH, fish, xonsh, and csh. bash is the most common.

## The Hows (aka the joys of installation)

### How do I install Terminal on the Mac?
You don't it's already installed. Search for it or find it within the Utilities folder in Applications.

Pro tip: The free Terminal replacement, iTerm2, is much nicer to work with on a Mac.

### How do I install bash on the Mac?
Again, it's already there. One thing that is helpful is to customize your bash prompt. That means making your bash prompt more user friendly and provide more information which can be useful when working with git.

To customize the prompt:
1. Copy the demo file `training-bash-rc` to
your home directory which is your user directory which is `carol` on my system. The full directory is `/Users/carol`.
2. The bash rc file is special. It's called a dotfile. It's really known as `.bashrc` located in your home directory.
3. We will open the `training-bash-rc` file in
an editor and then "Save As" `.bashrc` to your home directory i.e. `/Users/ana`.
