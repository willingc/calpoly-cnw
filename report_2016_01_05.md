### Documentation Sustainability and Effectiveness project
* Created a left hand doc sidebar section structure for Sphinx docs to give top
  level structure to all documentation in repos yet encourages flexibility in
  individual project docs within the structure
  - User Documentation (Documentation for usage of project)
	- Configuration
	- Developer Documentation (Documentation related to release development)
	- Community Documentation (Examples and Tutorials)
    - About (changelogs and history)
	- Questions & suggestions (mailing list, website, stack overflow links)
	- *Projects (documentation links)*
* Continued inventory of repos and related docs (what, freshness, and needs)
  - [01-05] Thinking about creating a dashboard using node and notebooks with
    github3py
* [GitHub doc recommendations](doc-workflow/docs-github.md) covering repo
  description and README file
* Sphinx (conf.py, index.rst, extensions, templates)
  - [01-05] Working on draft of recommendations (conf.py and index.rst are
    reasonably completed)
* ReadTheDocs (subprojects - research searching across all jupyter docs)
  - [01-05] Communicated with Eric Holscher of RTD about subprojects. Currently
    subprojects does not support search across the projects. They are looking
    for funding to make this happen.

### Jupyter Presentations and Outreach
